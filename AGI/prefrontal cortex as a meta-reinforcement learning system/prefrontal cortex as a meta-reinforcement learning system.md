# prefrontal cortex as a meta-reinforcement learning system

Critical Component for AGI

> 1. system with memory
> 
> 2. train a system on a bunch of tasks that differ on the surface but share some underlying statistical commonality 

recurrent nerual network in multi-task environments spontaneously give rise to the kind of learning to learn phenomena 


**fixed synaptic weights**
the reinforcement learning algorithm that adjusting the weights is the main effect of that learning is to adjust the activity dynamics of their current network so that eventually those recurrent dynamics themselves implement a learning algorhtm so that can be executed without any weight changes
